Other examples of properties not definable in [[FO]] are:
1. [[connectedness]]
2. [[finiteness]]
3. [[parity]] (even/odd)
4. [[2-colorability]]
Homework:
6. [[finiteness]] 
 $S=\mathbb{Z}$
 $S'=\mathbb{Z},-\mathbb{Z}$
 
 $S$ is the set of natural numbers.
 $S'$ is the set of Natural numbers concatenated with a set of negative natural numbers.
 
 The spoiler wins when he is able to force the Duplicator to choose the first element of the $-\mathbb{Z}$ as in $S$ the vertices left are always valued less than the vertices right. But at the point where $\mathbb{Z}$ and $-\mathbb{Z}$ meet we have that the left element is valued more than the vertice one further right.
 
 Question: Why not choose a finite set of nodes  ($2^n$) and a infinite set of nodes ($\mathbb{Z}$) and then do divide and conquer. The duplicator can survive depending on how high the number n is.

8. [[acyclicity]]
 
 All of them can be proven by [[Lemma 10]] and [[Theorem 1]]
