Choose appropriate *universes* and *signatures* and define the following properties in FO

## There are infinitely many prime numbers
Maybe we can define that every prime number has a prime number that follows?

## This graph is a [[clique]]
nodes and = are the signature

## This graph is [[strongly connected]]
This does not work, 
## In this tree, z is the least common ancestor of x and y

## In this string every a is followed by a b
Universe is a set of numbers denoting the position of the char
Relational symbols are A,B of unary Form
$a = \{2,5,6\} \subseteq U^S$
$b = \{3,9,10\} \subseteq U^S$

## Points x,y,z are on the same straight line
