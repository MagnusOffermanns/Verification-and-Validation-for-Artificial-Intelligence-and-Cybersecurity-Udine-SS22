>[!Exercise]
>Prove that [DBA](Buechi%20automata.md) are closed under union and intersection.
>Tipp: The proof for [Intersection](Intersection.md) is simmilar to the proof for [NBA](Buechi%20automata.md).
>In the case of the Union one has to change a bit. Because in the classical proof one exploits non-determinism. One has to find a way to build a [NBA](Buechi%20automata.md) that recognizes the [Union](Union.md) of two languages recognized by a [NBA](Buechi%20automata.md).
