# 1 As a feature of a formula
A formula is [contradiction](contradiction.md) if it is unsatisfiable (false in every structure/interpretation).

an example could be:
There exists a set that
contains all and only
the sets that do not 
contain themselves.
$\exists x \forall y(C(x,y) \iff \neg C(y,y))$

# 2 As way of a mathematical proof. 
We state a statement. Then we show that it does not apply. That means the statement is not true. 

This normally works very well when you only have two possible cases.
