aliases: non-emptyness problem

Asks the question: Is there a valid word in a certain language.

Is the same as the [[Satisfiability]] Problem.
# 1 [[w-regular|w-regular-language]]s
Closedness towards [[w-regular|w-regular-language]]smeans that also the complement of $L$ is also a [[w-regular|w-regular-language]].
