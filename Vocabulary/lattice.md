A [lattice](lattice.md) is an abstract structure studied in the mathematical subdisciplines of [[order theory]] and [[abstract algebra]]. It consists of a [[partially ordered set]] in which every pair of elements has a unique [[supremum]] (also called a least upper bound or [[join (mathematics)|join]]) and a unique [[infimum]] (also called a greatest lower bound or [[meet (mathematics)|meet]]). An example is given by the [[natural number]]s, partially ordered by [[divisibility]], for which the supremum is the [[least common multiple]] and the infimum is the [[greatest common divisor]].
