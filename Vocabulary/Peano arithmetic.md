$$FO[\mathbb{N},+,\cdot]$$

(sometimes undecidable (By reduction from Hilberts 10th problem, satisfiability of Diophantine equations), more powerful than [[Presburg arithmetic]])

[[Presburg arithmetic]] can be reduced to [[Peano arithmetic]]

[[Peano arithmetic]] can not be reduced to [[Tarski arithmetic]]
