Is the set of states that you can reach within a [[NFA with epsilon-move]] from a state $q$ by repeatedly applying only the empty word $\epsilon$.
This set of states is denoted as $\epsilon$-closure(q)

definition for multiple states:
For all $q \in 2^Q$ we can define the [[epsilon-closure]] of the set ($\underline{q}$)=$\bigcup\limits_{q\in \underline{q}} \epsilon\text{-closure}(q)$
