>[!note] [Maximal strongly connected subgraph](VV%20Strongly%20connected%20subgraph.md)
>An [VV SCS](VV%20Strongly%20connected%20subgraph.md) is a [Maximal strongly connected subgraph](VV%20Strongly%20connected%20subgraph.md) if it is not contained in any larger [VV SCS](VV%20Strongly%20connected%20subgraph.md) (remember that there exist at most as many [MSCS](VV%20Strongly%20connected%20subgraph.md)) as there are Atoms in the [Tableaux](Tableaux.md) i.e. $|T_\varphi|$


>[!Note] $\varphi$-reachable
>A [[VV Strongly connected subgraph]] S is $\varphi$-reachable [VV SCS](VV%20Strongly%20connected%20subgraph.md) if there exists a finite path $B_0,B_1,\dots,B_k$ such that $\varphi \in B_0$ and $B_k \in S$

>[!Note] terminal MSCS
>An MSCS $S$ is terminal if there are no edges leading from atoms of $S$ to atoms outside of $S$
