They are built from a finite set of words over $A$ (made of symbols of $A$) by using the operations:
> 1. $\cup$ (Union)
> 2. $\cdot$ ([[Concatenation]])
> 3. $*$ ([[Kleene-closure]] also called [[Kleene-closure|Kleene star]]) 
> 4. $\cap$ ([[Intersection]])
> 5. $\neg$([[Complementation]])

[[Restricted Regular Expression]]s and [[General Regular Expressions]] are equally expressive.
