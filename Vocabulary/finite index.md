The object has a finite amount of equivalence classes.

# 1 Example 1:
Two words are equivalent if the length of the words modulo 2 are the same.
Here we have two classes: 
1. The class with $mod(len(word))=1$
2. The class with $mod(len(word))=0$

# 2 Example 2
Two words are equivalent if they have the same amount of letter 'a'.
Here we have infinitely many classes:
1. the class with num(a,word)=0
2. the class with num(a,word)=1
3. the class with num(a,word)=2
4. ...
