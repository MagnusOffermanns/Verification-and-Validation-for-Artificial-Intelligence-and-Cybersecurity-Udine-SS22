Lets look at another extension, that preserves [[decideability]] is the following one: We can look at the natural numbers as a  [degenrate tree](tree.md). The degenerate tree we are looking at has the property that every node of the tree has only one successor (see left side of the image), which is equivalent to the natural numbers.

But we can extend it and transform this tree, to a binary tree where every node has two successors (right side of the tree), where we represent the nodes as binary numbers.

The [[Theory]] of the infite binary tree is [[decideability|decidable]] and the theory of it is called [[The monadic second order theory of two successors]] aka [[The monadic second order theory of two successors|S2S]].
