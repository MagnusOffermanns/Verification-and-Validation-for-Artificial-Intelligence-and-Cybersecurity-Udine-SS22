input:
formula $\phi_1$
formula $\phi_n$
output:
yes: if $\phi_1$ till $\phi_n$ hold over all S

usefull for:
if $\phi_1$ is very complex and $\phi_2$ is super trivial. If it turns out that they are logically equivalent we can use $\phi_2$ instead of $\phi_1$ and save a lot of calculations.

equivalence reduces to [[validity satifiability]]
