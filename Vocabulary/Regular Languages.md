A language $L \subseteq A^*$ is ==Regular== if it is accepted by a [[Deterministic Finite State Automata|DFA]] $\mathcal{A}$ that is $L=L(\mathcal{A})$

Using [[Theorem 2]] that shows that [[Non Deterministic Finite State Atomata|NFA]] and [[Deterministic Finite State Automata|DFA]] are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]]. We can state that:  [[Regular Languages]] are those languges $L\subset A^*$ that are recognized by the [[NFA]]
