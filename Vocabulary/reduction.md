A reduction from P to Q  is an algorithm F that solves P using an oracle that returns solutions to Q.

Imagine P being easier than Q.

We transform Q to be  easier. P should be easier afterwards using F

example:
many to one reduction: $\forall x, P(x) \iff Q(F(x))$ 

There are multiple kinds of reductions for instance:
- [[Logical reduction]]s
- [[Algorithmical reduction]]s
