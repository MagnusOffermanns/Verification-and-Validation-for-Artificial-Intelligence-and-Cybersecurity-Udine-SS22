<mark style="background: #014E11F2;">Satisfiability:</mark>

In mathematical logic, a formula is satisfiable if it is true under some assignment of values to its variables. For example, the formula $x+3=y$ is satisfiable because it is true when $x=3$ and $y=6$, while the formula $x+1=x$ is not satisfiable over the integers.
