You distribute a infinite amount of nodes all over a surface. Then you throw a coin for all possible node pairs. If head you connect the two nodes. If tails you do not connect the nodes.

Theorem:
If and only if the probability $Pr[G \models \phi]$ in a<mark style="background: #014E11F2;"> finite graph</mark> goes towards 1  it means that this formula $G$ always models $\phi$ in an <mark style="background: #014E11F2;">infinite graph</mark> 

[[Corollary 2 0/1 law for FO]]
- either $Pr[G \models \phi]$ tends to 1
- or $Pr[G \models \phi]$ tends to 0

This means that every [[FO - First order logic]] formula is
- either *almost surely true*
- or *almost surely false*
