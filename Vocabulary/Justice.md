[[Justice]] $JâŠ†T$
Is the set of transitions for which we demand [[Justice]]. For these states it is not possible that a state is always enabled but never taken. The state needs to be taken at least once.

In the printer example: There would be no [[Justice]] if Printers that are always ready to print but are never chosen to print anything

[[Compassion|strong fairness]] $\implies$ [[Justice|weak fairness]]
