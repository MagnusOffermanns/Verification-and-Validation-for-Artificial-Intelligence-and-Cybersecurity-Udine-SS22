- formula $\phi$ $\rightarrow$ checker $\rightarrow$ yes no 
output:
yes/no does $\phi$ hold over all possible S
$\phi$ needs to hold over all S and is more strict than the simple model checking problem

a formula is _valid_ if every assignment of values to its variables makes the formula true. For example, $x+3=3+x$ is valid over the integers, but $x+3=y$ is not.
