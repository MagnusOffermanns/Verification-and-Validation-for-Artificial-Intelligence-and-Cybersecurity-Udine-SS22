A computation is called [[P-Computation]] of a [[Fair Transition Systems|FTS]] if it satisfies the following conditions:

- (<mark style="background: #014E11F2;">initiality</mark>) $s_0$ satisfies  $\Theta$ and is therefore a initial state
- (<mark style="background: #014E11F2;">Consequentiality</mark>) for all $j=1,2,3,...n$ $s_{j+1}$ is a sucessor of $s_j$ for some $t$. i.e. every state has a sucessor.
- [[Justice]]:  all $t \in \mathcal{J}$ need to have [[Justice]].
- [[Compassion]] all $t \in \mathcal{C}$ have [[Compassion]]
