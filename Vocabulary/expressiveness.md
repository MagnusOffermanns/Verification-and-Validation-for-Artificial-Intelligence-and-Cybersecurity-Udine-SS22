The [expressiveness](expressiveness.md) of a logic explains what statements can be expressed in that logic.

This is often used in a comparative way.

If we have two logics $A$ and $B$ there might be four cases:
1. We can express the same statements 
2. $A$ can express more things than $B$ i.e. B $B \subseteq A$
3. $B$ can express more things than $A$ i.e. B $A \subseteq B$
4. $A$ and $B$ can express different things and can therefore not be compared
