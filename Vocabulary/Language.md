A [[Language]] $L$ over $A$ is a subset of $A^* (L \leq A^*)$  i.e. a language is a subset of words of $A^*$

A language can be described by a [Automata](Deterministic%20Finite%20State%20Automata.md), the words that a [Automata](Deterministic%20Finite%20State%20Automata.md) accept are part of the Language
