>[!Note] Fullfilling Atoms
> An [[Atom]] $A$ fullfills a formula $\psi$, that [Promises](Promise.md) $r$, if $\neg \psi \in A$ or $r \in A$

>[!Note] Fullfilling path
>A path $\pi =A_0,A_1,\dots$ in a [Tableaux](Tableaux.md) $T_\varphi$ is fullfilling if for every promising formular $\psi \in \phi_\varphi$ (formula in the [Closure](Closure.md)), $\pi$ contains infinitely many atoms $A_j$ which fullfill $\psi$ (that is either $\neg \psi \in A_j$ or $r \in A_j$ )
