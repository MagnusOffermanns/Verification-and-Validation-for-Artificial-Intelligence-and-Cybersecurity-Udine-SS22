title: [[Corollary 7]]
The [[Theory]] of [[Monadic second order of one sucessor|S1S]] is decidable.
```

In this case it means that we can decide if a [[Monadic second order of one sucessor|S1S]] formula is true or not.
Why can we decide? Because we can convert a [[Monadic second order of one sucessor|S1S]] formula to a [[Buechi automata]] and in the [[Buechi automata]] the [[decideability]] problem is the [[emptyness problem]] which is decidable.
