>[!Note] [[Theorem 25]] 
>[Muller Games](Muller%20Game.md) are [Determined](Strategy.md) and for each Muller game $(G, F)$, where $G$ has $n$ states, the winning regions for the two players can be effectively determined and it is possible to build, for each state $q$ in $G$, a finite state winning strategy from $q$ (for the winning player) making use of a memory with $n! \cdot n$ states.
