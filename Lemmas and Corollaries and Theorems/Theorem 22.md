>[!note] [[Theorem 22]]
>Let $A$ be a finite alphabet. An $\omega \text{-language}$ $L \subseteq A^{\omega}$ is first order definable in [S1SA](Monadic%20second%20order%20of%20one%20sucessor.md) if and only if  $L$ is obtained from $A^{\omega}$ by repeated application of Boolean operations and concatenations with star-free sets/languages $W \subseteq A^*$ on the left


$\omega \text{-languages}$ that satisfy the above condition of [Theorem 22](Theorem%2022.md) are called star-free $\omega \text{-languages}$.


Ladner showed that star free $\omega \text{-languages}$  are a proper subclass of $\omega \text{-languages}$.
