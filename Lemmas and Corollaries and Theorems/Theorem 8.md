> [!note] [[Theorem 8]]
> 1. if $V \subseteq A^*$ is regular, then $V^w$ is [[w-regular]].
> 2. If $V \subseteq A^*$ is regular and $L \subseteq A^w$ is [[w-regular]], then $V \cdot L$ is [[w-regular]].
> 3. $L_1,L_2 \subseteq A^w$ are [[w-regular]], then $L_1 \cup L_2$ and $L_1 \cap L_2$ are [[w-regular]] as well.
