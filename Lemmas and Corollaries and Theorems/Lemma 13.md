> Let $\sim$ which is a [[Congruence]] of finite index on $A^*$. For all [[omega-words|w-words]] $\alpha \in A^w$ there exist two classes $u,v$ of $\sim$ such that $\alpha \in u \cdot v^w$ with $v \cdot v \subseteq V$.

However I take a [[omega-words|w-word]] I am able to decompose it into a finite prefix $u$ and a infinite sequence of [[Word]]s belonging to $V$.  I.e. there is always a [[Equivalence]] that can split any [[omega-words|w-word]] in two classes. One class for $u$ and one class for the repeating part $v$.
