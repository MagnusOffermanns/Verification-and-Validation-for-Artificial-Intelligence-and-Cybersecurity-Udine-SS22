>[!Note] THeorem 24, Weak muller Theorem	
>[Weak muller game](Muller%20Game.md)s are [Determined](Strategy.md) and for each weak [Muller Game](Muller%20Game.md) $(G, F)$, where $G$ has $n$ states, the winning regions for the two players can be effectively determined and it is possible to build, for each state $q$ in $G$, a [Finite state winning strategy](Strategy.md)  from $q$ (for the winning player) making use of a memory with $2^n$ states.
