Model-checking [[QBF]]'s in [[Prenex Normal Form]] with n quantifiers ($\exists,\forall$) has the time complexity:

$$\Sigma_n=NP^{coNP^{...}} \text{ or } \Pi_n=coNP^{NP^{...}}$$

Application: the sequence of NP and co-NP depends on which quantors one uses: i.e. $\exists p \forall q \exists r \phi$ would have the complexity class $NP^{co-NP^{NP}}$
