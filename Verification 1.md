# 1 Overview
1. Background knowledge: on logic, automata, regular expressions, and games
2. Fair transition systems, automata on infinite objects
3. Temporal logic
4. Algorithms: satisfiable checking, model checking, synthesis
5. Verification and Validation techniques for Ai and cybersecurity

Aim of the course:
Key words:
formal specification and verification/ Validation
- verify the consistency of a specification
- check the validity of  an expected property of a program
- to synthesize a [[correct-by-construction controler]].

Reactive programs/systems vs transformational programs
